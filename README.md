We have provided a sample project, MiaSample, in the repository which is written in Swift 4.2 and it demonstrates MiA Nets EASY SDK usage and capabilities. To use it, download the repo, run **pod install** to download the required libraries and open **MiaSample.xcworkspace**. After that, navigate to **API.swift** to add your provided information from Nets Easy platform.

## Requirements
* MiA iOS SDK requires iOS 9 or above.

## Installation

### Carthage
* Add the following line to your Cartfile
```
github "nets-ecom/Nets-Easy-iOS-SDK"
```

* Run `carthage update` to get Mia SDK
* Navigate to Carthage/Builds/iOS for `Mia.framework`
* In your project **TARGET**, navigate to **GENERAL**
* Drag and drop `Mia.framework` to **Embedded Binaries**
* In any file you'd like to use Mia in, do not forget to import the framework with `import Mia`

### Manual
* Download/clone this https://github.com/nets-ecom/Nets-Easy-iOS-SDK.git to get Mia.framework
* In your project **TARGET**, navigate to **GENERAL**
* Drag and drop `Mia.framework` to **Embedded Binaries**
* In any file you'd like to use Mia in, do not forget to import the framework with `import Mia`

Xcode 11+ users can now replace Mia.framework in Xcode-Targets Frameworks, Libraries and Embedded Contents with Mia.XCFramework for iOS and iOS Simulator architectures.

## High level architecture of the Nets Easy SDK
The below picture illustrates the SDK and its interactions with the macro components of the integrationâ€™s environment.

## Usage
After setup is ready, using MiA SDK is easy. Initialize and present Mia SDK's checkout controller providing actions for success, cancelation and failure block parameters. The SDK will display a checkout WebView and invoke the action blocks accordingly. For full references, please refer to **Documentation** folder.

```swift
let miaSDK = MiaSDK.checkoutControllerForPayment(
    withID: paymentId,
    paymentURL: paymentURL,
    isEasyHostedWithRedirectURL: easyHostedRedirectURL,
    cancelURL: cancelURL,
    success: { controller in /* handle success */ },
    cancellation: { controller in /* handle cancellation */ },
    failure: { controller, error in /* handle failure */ }
)

present(miaSDK, animated: true)
```

**IMPORTANT**: While making the API call for creating a payment, make sure you add `"commercePlatformTag" : "iOSSDK"` in the request header. This is critical to identify the platform from which the payment is initiated.

```swift
let headers: HTTPHeaders = [
    "Authorization": token,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "commercePlatformTag" : "iOSSDK"
]
```


## Integration - Run Script

To assist integration of `Mia.framework` in your project, navigate to the project's target (under TARGETS) in Xcode and add the following _Run Script_ in _Build Phases_ section. If you want to avoid the error when running on simulator, please also check the box for this. Note: Run script only when installing!

```
APP_PATH="${TARGET_BUILD_DIR}/${WRAPPER_NAME}"

# This script loops through the frameworks embedded in the application and
# removes unused architectures.
find "$APP_PATH" -name 'Mia.framework' -type d | while read -r FRAMEWORK
do
FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_NAME=$(defaults read "$FRAMEWORK/Info.plist" CFBundleExecutable)
FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH="$FRAMEWORK/$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_NAME"
echo "Executable is $FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH"

EXTRACTED_ARCHS=()

for ARCH in $ARCHS
do
echo "Extracting $ARCH from $FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_NAME"
lipo -extract "$ARCH" "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH" -o "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-$ARCH"
EXTRACTED_ARCHS+=("$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-$ARCH")
done

echo "Merging extracted architectures: ${ARCHS}"
lipo -o "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-merged" -create "${EXTRACTED_ARCHS[@]}"
rm "${EXTRACTED_ARCHS[@]}"

echo "Replacing original executable with thinned version"
rm "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH"
mv "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-merged" "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH"

done
```
